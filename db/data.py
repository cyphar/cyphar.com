		"description": "This paper came about due to research I was working on within the asteroseismology group at the University of Sydney. After working on figuring out how to do analysis of targets inside the *Kepler* K2 field, a couple of techniques were being worked on -- the one outlined in this paper being one of them. [Benjamin Pope](http://www-astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/~popeb/) and [Tim White](http://www.astro.physik.uni-goettingen.de/~twhite/) did most of the work refining this technique and applying it, my own research uses a very different technique.",
